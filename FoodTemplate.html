    <h2>Today I will be going over my top food choices.</h2>

    <p>Food is great, but something that's even better is to knwo what type of food you personally like to eat.</p>
    <p>Typically the food I eat with my family is spicy.</p>
    <p>Food that I get with my friends would probably be fast food.</p>
    <p>Also maybe on vacations I would something sweet.</p>
    <p>It all really depends on what type of food you like and what your taste is.</p>

    <h2> Sriman's Top Choices</h2>

    <img src = "IMG-Me.jpg" alt = "Picture Of You" height = "250px" width = "150px">
    <p>Let's start with Pizza. It's simple, generic, tastes good, and the best part is that you can choose how you want it.</p>
    <p>Macaroni and Cheese. Mac and Cheese is also an original option, you can chose different varieties of it.</p>
    <p>Pasta or Noodles. This is great because you have so many options and can do a lot of things with this choice.</p>
    <p>I am going to end this list with a favorite of mine, Chicken Wings. Whether it's boneless or not, you can't go wrong with em.</p>
